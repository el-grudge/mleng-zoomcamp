In week 1️⃣  we covered:

- 🧠🤖 What is machine learning and what is it used for
- 🧠🤖 🆚 📜📏 Machine learning systems vs. rule based systems (Good Old AI)
- 🧑‍🏫🤖📚 Supervised machine learning, how it works, and the different kinds of problems it can solve (📈🔍🔢 regression, 📦✅❌ classification, and 🏆📊🥇 ranking)
- 🏢🔄📈 The CRISP-DM process model, describing a series of steps that standardize the machine learning process:  
1- Business understanding  
2- Data understanding  
3- Data preparation  
4- Modeling  
5- Evaluation  
6- Deployment
- 🤔 ➡️ 🤖 ➡️ 📈 How to choose a model and the multiple comparison problem
- ![Local Image](pictures/icons8-numpy-20.png)Introduction to NumPy 
- 🧮 Introduction to Linear Algebra
- ![Local Image](pictures/icons8-pandas-20.png)Introduction to Pandas  

In my current role as a data analyst I spend most of my time in the first three steps of the CRISP-DM model, usually working with the project managers / clients on understanding the business, creating documentation and frameworks for these processes, and using SQL to learn about the data and discern any inconsistencies. The data science team then takes over, building and evaluating the models. So this is a good opportunity to refresh my memory on these topics.  

For week 1, our homework involved:  
* Installing Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
* Using pandas to read a data set, finding whether any of the columns had null values, filling those values, and calculating the mean
* Using numpy for matrix multiplication, transposition and inversion
